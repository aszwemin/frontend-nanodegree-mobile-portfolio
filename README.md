## Website Performance Optimization portfolio project

I have optimized several things to get scores over 90, which included pictures optimization, css and js inclusion optimization and minifying.

I used gulp to create several automated task, gulpfile.js is included in the files (I used http://www.sitepoint.com/introduction-gulp-js/ as a reference).

All of the gulp built files are in build/ and views/build/ directories.

Non minified files are left in their initial location.
